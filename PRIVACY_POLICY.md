Welcome to Step Challenge App! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

## COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App includes:

### Personal Data
Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, and profile picture, that you voluntarily give to us when you register with the App through a third-party service like Apple or Facebook.

### Health and Fitness Data
With your explicit permission, we access health and fitness data, specifically your daily step count, from your device's health-tracking services (Apple HealthKit for iOS and Health Connect for Android). We only read step data to provide the core functionality of the App, such as tracking your progress and participating in challenges. We do not write or modify any health data on your device.

### Third-Party Login Information
When you choose to log in using Facebook or Apple, we receive basic profile information from these services, such as your name, email, and user ID. We do not have access to your password for these services.

### Data Stored in Google Sheets
All your personal data, including your user ID, name, email, daily step goals, and daily step history, is stored in a private Google Sheet that is managed by the App's administrators. This data is used solely for the operation and synchronization of the App's features across your devices.

### Push Notifications
We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or challenges. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.

## USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

## DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.

## SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
